## Welcome to my Palindrome Checker!

Discover the simplicity and efficiency of checking if a word, phrase, or number is a palindrome with this interactive web application. As a passionate developer, I've created a tool that brings functionality and ease of use together. Explore this project and see how it works! ðŸš€

## Project Description

This project is based on freeCodeCamp's Certification Project: [Build a Palindrome Checker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-palindrome-checker-project/build-a-palindrome-checker). It features a well-structured, user-friendly application where users can check if their input text or numbers are palindromes. The checker ignores letter case and automatically removes punctuation and spaces, making it efficient and easy to use. It's a great demonstration of basic web development skills, combining HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Features

- **Case Insensitivity:** Ignores letter case while checking for palindromes.
- **Punctuation and Space Handling:** Automatically removes punctuation and spaces from the input.
- **Numeric Palindromes:** Supports checking of numeric palindromes like "12321".

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the content structure.
- **CSS:** For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** For interactivity and logic.

## File Structure

- **index.html:** Main HTML file containing the structure of the web application.
- **css/styles.css:** Main CSS file for styling the web application.
- **js/script.js:** JavaScript file containing the logic for checking palindromes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/palindrome-checker.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd palindrome-checker`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the Palindrome Checker.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a word, phrase, or number into the input field.
3. Click the "Check" button or press the Enter key to see the result.
4. The result will indicate whether the input is a palindrome or not.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the content, styles, and functionality to suit your needs. You can modify the CSS for different themes and appearances, and expand the JavaScript logic for more features.
